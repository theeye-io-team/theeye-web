## How to work with tasks and notifications.

The toolkit allows you to streamline the flow of notifications and trigger them.

The notifications can have different origins:

- A script task, you can send your output parameters as input for a notification task.

- An input task, allows an operator to load the parameters of the msg that will receive the notification task.

- A notification can be part of a workflow.

### Triggered by events
The notification task can be triggered by other task or monitor as shown below:

#### Triggered by _Input_ task

The input task is responsible for getting the data that will be delivered to the notification task.

Check the [Task input](/core-concepts/tasks/) for more details.

#### Triggered by _Script_ task or monitor

This task is responsible for executing the code that generates the output required as input parameters for the notification task.

Check the [Task scripts](/core-concepts/tasks/) for more details.


#### Notification task's arguments

In order to work with dynamic arguments for a notification task, the script task must generate the output with the following format.

```json
["subject","the email body raw text or html","info@theeye.io"]
```

The 3 arguments are required. If you need to ignore one argument or prioritize the once set in the task definition, use an empty string ""

In this example, the third argument is ignored and the recipients from the task definition will be used.

```json
["subject","the email body raw text or html",""]
```


| Name | Format | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| subject | plain text | this is the subject for all notifications configured to send in the task definition |
| body | plain text/html | this is the email body |
| recipients | text/json array | the destination user emails registered in theeye. could be a single email or an array of multiples emails |
