```bash
mkdir /etc/theeye; cp /opt/theeye-agent/misc/theeye/theeye.conf /etc/theeye/theeye.conf
```

### Step 3.

Setup the configuration file

OPTIONAL. Get the agent version and update the config file with it. The will be reported from the web panel

```bash
git describe
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# export all vars hereunder
